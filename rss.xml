            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>International GT Open 2015 - Red Bull Ring, Austria</h1><p>Another first for me in 2015 and an incredible road trip from Salzburg through the mountains to Spielberg and the incredible Red Bull Ring.  By far the hottest weekend of the season and not just in terms of the weather, the action was fantastic and the facilities, well, the best I've been to.  The hosts were incredible, the reception, shop and media centre are all excpetional and the circuit was immaculate.  I am very much looking forward to a return to this fantastic, incredibly picturesque track. track</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/99ca0b1e1fffd7b2eaf2cbb8b6c16692bde55894.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>International GT Open 2015 - Silverstone, United Kingdom</h1><p>A return to my home circuit.  A track I have had the honour of photographing a number of times for various clients in British GT series, Blancpain and GT Cup Championship.  Silverstone is a fast circuit with iconic corners and instantly recognisable landmarks including the BRDC Club and The Wing .  Again, not only were we blessed with great racing, but also, a weekend of warm, dry weather.....perfect!</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/058f7cf616e3b597aa058fe8dbccd1364f2e86bc.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>International GT Open 2015 - Paul Ricard, France</h1><p>This gallery captures a small amount of my work whilst covering the opening round of the International GT Open race series.  The series takes in some of the finest circuits in the world as you will see from my other galleries.  Paul Ricard is a very special place with a crazy number of track configurations, a huge straight, innovative run-off areas and instantly recognisable run-off areas designed to slow cars down quickly.  Nestled on the south coast a short drive from the Cote D'Azur, Nice and Monaco, the weather was superb and perfect for the opening round.  It didn't disappoint!</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/09d544097ced03f976ee46677ce3e8df8f237be0.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>International GT Open 2015 - Estoril, Portugal</h1><p>Arriving at Estoril for the first time is quite special.  Having watched F1 as a child there was something captivating about the circuit, maybe the elevation changes or the variety of corners, maybe the stunning backdrop, more than likely the combination of all of that.  Estoril is in a beautiful part of the world, the weather was spectacular, the crowd fantastic and the racing, even better!</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/01ddfeaf2367fba7a45b6525388e918111355719.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>'Orca' by BAC Mono</h1><p>A wonderful, symmetrical design from BAC Mono.  One of my favourites blending paint and visible carbon in perfect amounts.  The symmetry is awesome as is the design, using the body lines to draw the eye across the car and back.  Love it!</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/064683618ee6cb2845c594fd5a421f7c88a7339f.jpg"></article>]]></description>
