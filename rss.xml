            <title><![CDATA[Arriving at Estoril for the first time is quite special.  Having watched F1 as a child there was something captivating about the circuit, maybe the elevation changes or the variety of corners, maybe the stunning backdrop, more than likely the combination of all of that.  Estoril is in a beautiful part of the world, the weather was spectacular, the crowd fantastic and the racing, even better!]]></title>

            <title><![CDATA[A return to my home circuit.  A track I have had the honour of photographing a number of times for various clients in British GT series, Blancpain and GT Cup Championship.  Silverstone is a fast circuit with iconic corners and instantly recognisable landmarks including the BRDC Club and The Wing .  Again, not only were we blessed with great racing, but also, a weekend of warm, dry weather.....perfect!]]></title>

            <title><![CDATA[Another first for me in 2015 and an incredible road trip from Salzburg through the mountains to Spielberg and the incredible Red Bull Ring.  By far the hottest weekend of the season and not just in terms of the weather, the action was fantastic and the facilities, well, the best I've been to.  The hosts were incredible, the reception, shop and media centre are all excpetional and the circuit was immaculate.  I am very much looking forward to a return to this fantastic, incredibly picturesque track.]]></title>

            <title><![CDATA[This was my first time covering a 24 hour race and where better that the epic Spa-Francorchamps.  Shooting everything from the race car parade into Spa centre to the podium it was a challenge and and real rush at the same time.  As you would expect, the weather threw everything at us. Cold, rain, hail, sunshine, we had it all and got stuck in most of it!  The 24 hour part was toughest at about 05:00 some 15 hours in, but in reality it wasn't 24 hours for me, my 'shift' was closer to 38 hours and I loved every minute of it.  Hope you enjoy looking at some of my memories from that glorious weekend.]]></title>
