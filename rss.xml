            <title><![CDATA[Blancpain Endurance Series - Total 24 Hours of Spa 2015]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Blancpain Endurance Series - Total 24 Hours of Spa 2015</h1><p>This was my first time covering a 24 hour race and where better that the epic Spa-Francorchamps.  Shooting everything from the race car parade into Spa centre to the podium it was a challenge and and real rush at the same time.  As you would expect, the weather threw everything at us. Cold, rain, hail, sunshine, we had it all and got stuck in most of it!  The 24 hour part was toughest at about 05:00 some 15 hours in, but in reality it wasn't 24 hours for me, my 'shift' was closer to 38 hours and I loved every minute of it.  Hope you enjoy looking at some of my memories from that glorious weekend.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/1ab9957d2cbddab7f33168e2d9822498b4794c54.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>International GT Open 2015 - Red Bull Ring, Austria</h1><p>Another first for me in 2015 and an incredible road trip from Salzburg through the mountains to Spielberg and the incredible Red Bull Ring.  By far the hottest weekend of the season and not just in terms of the weather, the action was fantastic and the facilities, well, the best I've been to. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/05fa0097fd8ea9831c4864102e30b45250309b07.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>International GT Open 2015 - Estoril, Portugal</h1><p>Arriving at Estoril for the first time is quite special.  Having watched F1 as a child there was something captivating about the circuit, maybe the elevation changes or the variety of corners, maybe the stunning backdrop, more than likely the combination of all of that.  Estoril is in a beautiful part of the world, the weather was spectacular, the crowd fantastic and the racing, even better!</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f690eb63bb4a0383cd54a5e898a2ac544387e286.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>International GT Open 2015 - Silverstone, United Kingdom</h1><p>A return to my home circuit.  A track I have had the honour of photographing a number of times for various clients in British GT series, Blancpain and GT Cup Championship.  Silverstone is a fast circuit with iconic corners and instantly recognisable landmarks including the BRDC Club and The Wing .  Again, not only were we blessed with great racing, but also, a weekend of warm, dry weather.....perfect!</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/058f7cf616e3b597aa058fe8dbccd1364f2e86bc.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>International GT Open 2015 - Spa-Francorchamps, Belgium</h1><p>How many words can describe this place?  Legendary, frightening, awesome, fast, beautiful, HUGE!  Let's not forget the fact that the weather does what it wants, when it wants!  Spa is sensational to shoot, the racing is always top quality and I love coming back here time and again.  There is a special feel about the place and you can't help but think of the history, the landscape and how much your feet are going to ache at the end of the weekend!</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e5f2584a9833803eaedec62f488bc33fa967f7e4.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>International GT Open 2015 - Monza, Italy</h1><p>From one epic, iconic circuit to another, Monza.  Nestled in a beautiful park this brutal, flat-out race track is a test of nerve.  Full throttle for the vast majority of the time strains the engines, the brakes get hammered too trying to slow the car down for tight chicanes and the infamous parabolica. </p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/12b8b554192a90486c5f2ea1ae95aa62922bff5b.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>International GT Open 2015 - Catalunya, Spain</h1><p>Another 'first' for me in 2015 and what a way to end an incredible season, the championship decider at the last weekend and my team in second with a chance to clinch the title.  The late Autumn weather spoiled us with warmth and sunshine and the circuit didn't fail to deliver.  Similar in style to Estoril, Catalunya is fantastic to shoot and with the addition of inner and outer service roads that I was allowed to drive on, this was an absolute pleasure of a job!</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/da8223a4bf13d8b70a9c68338ea28396ccf38d85.jpg"></article>]]></description>
